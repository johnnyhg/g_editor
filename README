A textile WYSIWYG editor.
It is from sanskrit: http://tore.darell.no/sanskrit/
Added list and color functions which need for my demand.
Example see: http://zhangzhe.heroku.com/g_editor/g_editor, and here is some other information: http://zhangzhe.heroku.com/blogs/11-Textile-WYSIWYG-editor.

I will keep improving it.
Anything unclear please email me at gary20071226@gmail.com.
Have fun:)
